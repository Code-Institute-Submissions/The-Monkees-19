       <h2>The Monkees with Mike Nesmith and Micky Dolenz to tour Australia in 2019</h2>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/boHdMaV4s0U"></iframe>
            </div>
        
    
        <p>
    The last Australia tour featured Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork. Nesmith has not been to Australia since his solo tour of 1977.

I love being on stage with Micky,” says Nesmith. “We’ve been collaborating for over 50 years, so it’s hard to believe it’s never been just the two of us. I’m excited to dust off some tunes that I haven’t played for a long time too. These are going to be some fun shows.”

Mike Nesmith wrote many of The Monkees songs including ‘Mary Mary’ and ‘Listen to the Band’.</p>
    <p>“Right from the get-go, I admired Mike’s songs. When we used to get together around
    the campfire to sing in the early days, we were always doing his songs,” says Dolenz.
    “We always had such a great a vocal blend; he was the one who encouraged me to write 
    songs of my own. I’ve always been a big fan and now we finally get to do the Mike & 
    Micky show that we riffed on back when we were shooting The Monkees.”

       <h2>Peter Tork dies age 77</h2>

        <p>
    Peter Tork, the bassist for the Monkees, has died aged 77.
    Tork, who also sang on a number of the band’s songs and played keyboards, had been diagnosed with
    a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009, though the cause of his death, which was confirmed by his sister, 
    has not been announced.</p>
    <p>Born in Washington DC in 1942, Tork – whose real name was Peter Thorkelson – joined the 
    Monkees when he was 24 after the quartet were brought together by US TV executives aiming 
    to create a teenage guitar-pop sensation to match the Beatles. Tork was recommended to audition by 
    Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and was already an accomplished musician in his own 
    right, having played on the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960s. He said he was “mortified” 
    when he turned up to an early Monkees studio date to be told that their band’s album had already been 
    recorded by session musicians.
